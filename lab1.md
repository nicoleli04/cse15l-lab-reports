============
##This is a tutorial showing how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6

**Installing/Accessing VScode**

> Since my computer already had VScode installed from taking CSE8B last quarter, I did not need to install VScode.

1. Find VScode on your laptop using the search bar

2. Open VScode



**Remotely Connecting**
1. Install Git

> I already have Git installed but for the tutorial use this: 

2. Open a terminal on VScode and type in **ssh [your usename]@ieng6.ucsd.edu**, your username should be from your course specific account and it should be in the form of  cs15lwi23zz.

3. You will receive a message like this: 
> â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 

respond **yes**

3. Enter your password 
> the terminal will not show you typing anything while you are entering in the password.

4. You should have something like this:



Congratulations! Your terminal is now connected to a computer in the CSE basement!
