**Remotely Connecting**
---
1. Install Git

> I already have Git installed. 

2. Open a terminal on VScode (make sure it uses git bash) and type in `ssh [your usename]@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, your username should be from your course specific account and it should be in the form of cs15lsp23zz.

3. You will receive a message like this: 
â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 

respond `yes`.

3. Enter your password 
> note that the terminal will not show you typing anything while you are entering in the password.

4. You should have something like this:
